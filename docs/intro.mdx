A future represents a read-only asynchronous value, one that may
not have finished computation yet. A basic future could look like:

```lua
local Futures = require("@packages/LuauFutures")
local Future = Futures.Future

local myFuture = Future.new(function()
    yield()
    return 1, 2, 3
end)
```

When you create a future, it wont begin execution until it is either
polled or awaited.

Polling will advance the future to it's next resumption point every
time that it is called, returning a [Poll] to let you check the status
of the future.

If the Poll is ready, you can also unwrap it to get the [Result].
```lua
local poll = myFuture:poll()
if poll:isReady() then
    local result = poll:unwrap()
    -- Handle result
end
```

Awaiting a future will yield the current thread until the future
finishes execution. As such, it is recommended that you only use
the await method within other futures, preferring to use poll instead.

```lua
local result = myFuture:await()
-- Handle result
```

To read the result, you can use [Result:isOk] or [Result:isErr] to
check what type the Result is.

You can then use [Result:unwrapOk] or [Result:unwrapErr] to get the
value of the result.

```lua
if result:isOk() then
    print(result:unwrapOk()) -- 1, 2, 3
elseif result:isErr() then
    warn(result:unwrapErr()) -- An error occurred
end
```

There are also several other methods for chaining, combining, and
mapping futures, as well as other utilities for working with futures.

It is suggested to read the [API Documentation](/api/Future) for more
information about these methods.
